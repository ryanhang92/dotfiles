# Issues

Cannot find "go" binary. Update PATH or GOROOT appropriately
    -I think this is because i have not built the project
    -

I had an issue where the go path was not set, i should set this here
This extension uses a host of Go tools to provide the various rich features. These tools are installed in your GOPATH by default. If you wish to have the extension use a separate GOPATH for its tools, provide the desired location in the setting go.toolsGopath. Read more about this and the tools at Go tools that the Go extension depends on.

* That did not work i think because it was installed in homebrew the binary was not found in the valid path, i actually just installed go from the website and then vs code started working - it must have installed it in the right place for it to pick up on those things
