clone this to ~/ and then run the install.sh script!

Note: While setting up for linux dev environment
1. The "copying Zsh configuration files"  script defined in the Prezto readme and

2. neovim setup fails because the init.vim needs to be changed with the instructions from :help nvim-from-vim, ensure that there is invalid vim linking code @ ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
